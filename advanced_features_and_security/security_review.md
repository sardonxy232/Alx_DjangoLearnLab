# Django HTTPS and Security Review

## Implemented Measures

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True`: Forces all requests over HTTPS.
- Nginx configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

### 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Enabled with 1-year policy.
- Includes subdomains.
- Preload directive enabled.

### 3. Secure Cookies
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
Ensures cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.

### 4. Secure Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'`: Prevents clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True`: Disables MIME-sniffing.
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True`: Enables browser XSS protection.

### 5. Deployment
- SSL certificate configured via Nginx and Let’s Encrypt.
- Nginx set to enforce HTTPS and apply security headers.

## Recommendations
- Use Django’s `SecurityMiddleware` and ensure it's first in the `MIDDLEWARE` list.
- Periodically review security settings with `check --deploy`.

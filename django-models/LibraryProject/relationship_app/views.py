# Implement Function-based View:

# Create a function-based view in relationship_app/views.py that lists all books stored in the database.
# This view should render a simple text list of book titles and their authors.
# Implement Class-based View:

# Create a class-based view in relationship_app/views.py that displays details for a specific library, listing all books available in that library.
# Utilize Djangoâ€™s ListView or DetailView to structure this class-based view.
# Configure URL Patterns:

# Edit relationship_app/urls.py to include URL patterns that route to the newly created views. Make sure to link both the function-based and class-based views.
